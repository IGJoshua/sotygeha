# sotyge'a
sotyge'a is a grammar for the lojban language based on zantufa which is intended to reduce the number of selma'o.

## FA -> BAI
The selma'o FA has been merged into the selma'o BAI.

### FA Conversion
Under zantufa, FA can be placed before the selbri of a bridi to perform a conversion similarly to SE. Under sotyge'a, this is no longer possible as FA no longer exists. Conversion falls back to SE. The one feature which this change affects is the following construct:

    ko'a fa je fe broda

This cannot be accomplished with SE, however can be approximated with JAI:

    ko'a jai fa je fe broda

This has similar meaning, differing only in that ko'a is sumti raised.

### I BAI BO-linked bridi
In zantufa lojban two bridi can be linked by a BAI, semantically equal to making the second bridi into an abstraction under the BAI in the first bridi.

    broda .iki'ubo brode

This can now be extended to the fa series of cmavo:

    broda .ifebo brode

The following is an example sentence with translation:

    .i mi troci .ifebo mi tavla do bau la .lojban.

> I try to talk to you in lojban.
